## Introduction
These Jupyter, or ipython, notebooks can query for and visualize and compare certain test data for different weekly builds. JupyterLab allows users to run these notebooks. Two types of notebooks are provided: Regression Analysis and Platform Certification. Each type has three individual notebooks, each of which corresponding to a different release (7.0.0, 7.0.1 and 7.1.0).
